ROI/DCA calculator for Bitcoin
By Brian Hartford

This is a return on investment/dollar cost averaging calculator for Bitcoin. The user will interact with a graphical user interface, where they will enter a past date they would have purchased Bitcoin on as well as the dollar amount they would have spent. 

The program then scrapes historical price data from CoinMarketCap.com to determine how much Bitcoin the user's money would buy on that particular date. The program then scrapes the current price of Bitcoin and calculates the difference in value denominated in USD.

The program will return the ROI expressed as a percentage and a dollar amount to the GUI. All of the data used in calculations will be exported to a csv file sot he user can save these scenarios and calculate gains if using the dollar cost averaging investment method.
